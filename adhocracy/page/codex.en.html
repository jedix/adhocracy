	<h3>1. Fair Cooperation</h3>
	<p> Don't forget about or ignore basic rules of respect and decency even in this virtual online world - we communicate with real people who all are entitled to have and express their opinion.</p>   
		
		<h3>2. No illegal or unethical content</h3> 
		<p>No illegal or unethical words, posts, links, or attachments. No pornographic, extremist, racist, discriminatory, sexist, satanistic, insulting, defamatory, arrogant posts etc.; no glorification of violence. Please observe the law.</p>   
		
		<h3>3. Don't encourage irresponsible behavior.</h3>
		 <p>Encouragement of and advertisement for irresponsible, harmful, violent, illegal or ethically questionable behavior will not be tolerated and will lead to exclusion from the community.</p>   
		
		<h3>4. Criticism</h3> 
		<p>Expression of critical opinions is welcome; insults, abuse, and threats are not. Try to remain factual and constructive, even if you are angry. Every user has the right to express and react to criticism. Give your opponent the opportunity to respond.</p>   
		
		<h3>5. Dialogue</h3> 
		<p>The intention of liqd.net is the advancement of societal discourse. Hence an animate exchange of opinions is essential; this means that participants can and will hold different opinions. liqd.net gives everyone the opportunity to express their opinion. It goes without saying that no one should be insulted, slandered or have their personal rights violated. It is advisable to critically review your own contributions and keep in mind that irony and sarcasm easily lead to misunderstandings in written communication.</p>   
		
		<h3>6. Observe the Netiquette</h3> 
		<p>Observe the principles of netiquette, politeness and tactfulness. We expect users to behave in an ethically appropriate, friendly way. Don't patronise and belittle other users by means of ostensible expertise. In this community, the quality of your contribution counts, not your title.</p>   
		
		<h3>7. Confidentiality</h3> 
		<p>Please keep in mind that liqd.net is public. Think twice about what you want to publicly reveal. Confidentialities, internal matters or intimate details don't belong here; there are things that should be dealt with in a private conversation rather than on a public online platform.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind that political opinions might in some cases unfortunately still cause you trouble when you publicly express them. In some cases it may be advisable to use a pseudonym.</p>
