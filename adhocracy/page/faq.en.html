<h3 id="WhatisAdhocracy">What is Adhocracy?</h3>
<p>
	A weird piece of code that does a half-baked version of Liquid Democracy
</p>
<h3 id="WhatisLiquidDemocracy">What is Liquid Democracy?</h3>
<p>
	A buzzword <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/16/201556/896|">created
	in 2003</a>. While many use the term Liquid Democracy to describe internet-based
 	Delegated Voting (a voting mechanism), Adhocracy goes beyond that. The essence of 
 	Liquid Democracy is the <strong>tight coupling of a networked voting system to an open system for 
 	the discussion and development of policy alternatives</strong>.
 </p>
<p>
	While traditional online discussion systems are a great way to
generate new ideas, they frequently fail to <strong>prioritize and filter</strong> them.
This leads to situations in which the most outrageous and absurd
proposals receive the most detailed discussion, while more realistic
options are drowned in the noise. A convenient method to filter such
proposals is to <strong>allow users to vote</strong> on them. This way, the community can
learn whether a proposal lacks essential support among its members,
whether the proposal needs some more work or whether it is generally
accepted and can become part of the group's policies or even of the
political agenda of that organization.
</p>
<p>
	Involving many users in an online poll can be hard, since the
degree to which individual users engage in an online discussion is
highly varied. Yet any meaningful poll must reflect not only the loud
and ever-present voices, but also those who cannot and do not want to
spare as much time on a specific debate as others. Liquid Democracy 
allows these users to <strong>make a simpler choice</strong> instead: they can name an agent whose position in
one or many debates they want to support. This agent will be given the
right to vote on their principal's behalf. Yet this delegation, unlike a
proper voting proxy, is a soft connection which can be reviewed,
overridden or entirely cancelled at any moment. In a way, delegated
voting is <strong>a recommendation mechanism</strong> that works like the song
recommendations a service like last.fm produces.
</p>
<p>
	In Liquid Democracy, opinions are no longer just a private matter but instead become the
subject of <strong>a dynamic network based around both topics and opinion
leaders</strong>. This reflects the structure of a networked public implied in
tools such as Facebook and Twitter.
</p>
<p>
	An extreme use case of this, of course, would be to do actual
lawmaking. Adhocracy is not made for this, and personally I don't think
its a very smart idea. Lawmaking should be based on a fairly
conservative, safe process. If you want to do it, go ahead but don't
blame the tool if it fails.
</p>

<h3 id="Howdoesvotingwork">How does voting work?</h3>

<p>Adhocracy allows users to vote on proposals - so-called proposals -
to determine the degree of support they have within the community. In
order to bring an idea to be voted upon, the following steps are needed:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A proposal is created <strong>within an appropriate issue</strong>. It will
	have both a <string>formal and an informal description</string>.</li>
	<li>The formal descriptions, so-called provisions, are modular.
	While a proposal <strong>needs only a single provision</strong> to be voted upon, it can
	have an arbitrary number of them.
	<ul>
		<li>In order to be considered for a vote, any provision must
		have been up-voted at least once, and have a positive score. Any
		provision that was down-voted will be discarded for the length of the
		poll.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A proposal needs to be explicitly <strong>called into the voting state</strong>
	to allow for ballots to be cast.
	<ul>
		<li>The vote can be called by the proposal's creator, an
		administrator or any user who has met the "call for a vote" karma
		threshold. Future versions of Adhocracy might require multiple users
		to agree for a vote begin.</li>
		<li>A vote can be called at any time. There is no pre-defined
		schedule that mandates voting in specific intervals or at defined
		dates.</li>
		<li>Polls can last for any number of days or weeks and need not
		be stopped at any time. A successful vote (reaching the 'active'
		state) will last for as long as the proposal is in effect. This
		principle could be called <em>Continuous Legitimization</em>.</li>
		<li>While voting, the provisions that have been included in the
		poll cannot be modified. This is required to allow decisions to be
		made on a fixed proposal.</li>
		<li>While voting, the proposal can adopt various states: it is
		"voting" when it has not yet reached the required majority;
		"activating" when it has reached its majority but not yet held it for
		the required delay or "active" when all conditions are met.</li>
		<li>While voting, neither a proposal nor the issue to which it is
		associated can be modified. The vote needs to be cancelled first.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A <strong>vote can be cancelled at any time</strong> unless it has acquired the
	required majority. When that happens, a proposal becomes entirely
	immutable and cannot be modified without first losing its support among
	the voters.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Whatareproposalstates">What are proposal states?</h3>
<p>Proposals have a life cycle that leads them from being drafts to
community-approved documents. Which state a proposal is in depends on
whether it has been released and on the number of votes it has
for/against it.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>draft</strong>: A draft proposal is not yet finished and can still be
	edited by any member of the Adhocracy.</li>
	<li><strong>voting</strong>: After a vote was called, a proposal is "voting"; any
	user can cast a vote on the proposal.</li>
	<li><strong>activating</strong>: After gathering approval by the required majority
	of the participants (usually two thirds of the voters), a proposal is
	activating and must maintain that majority for a certain delay (usually
	7 days) in order to become active.</li>
	<li><strong>active</strong>: The proposal is approved by the community and can be
	seen as part of their established codex.</li>
	<li><strong>deactivating</strong>: When a proposal loses the required majority, it is
	re-transferred to the voting state. Similar to the activating state
	this transition is delayed. Deactivating proposals are, therefore, still
	an active part of an accepted consensus.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3 id="Whatisdelegatedvoting">What is delegated voting?</h3>
<p>Delegation helps voters to make their voice heard in a decision
even if they cannot or <strong>do not want to explicitly vote</strong> on certain
proposals. A delegation is an authorization of one user (the principal)
to allow another user (the agent) to vote on his or her behalf. Each
delegation is valid within a certain scope, e.g. with regards to a
political area like climate policy. This means that <strong>the agent can vote
on the principal's behalf</strong> in all decisions that are marked to be inside
the given scope. The delegations of a voter can thus be seen as his or
her personal cabinet. In this cabinet, one agent is responsible for
making decisions regarding the subject area A, while another agent is
responsible for making decisions in a second subject area, B.</p>
<p>The special properties of Adhocracy's delegation system include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Unanimity</strong>: When a voter has delegated voting on a certain
	proposal to two or more agents, his or her vote will only be counted if
	both agents make the same decision. <strong>If the agents disagree, no vote
	will be cast</strong> by their principal unless he or she does so manually. This
	can be used to intentionally limit the power of an agent in a specific
	domain by requiring a second delegate to concur.</li>
	<li><strong>Transitivity</strong>: If a delegation is created in which the agent
	has delegated their voting powers themselves, the principals vote will
	be available to the agents agent. In other words: If A delegates to B
	and B delegates to C, then C can vote on A's behalf. This can be used
	to <strong>quickly reproduce the delegation decisions another voter has made</strong>: A
	voter can just delegate to the other voter, instead of reproducing all
	individual delegations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Whoshouldonedelegatevotingto">Who should one delegate
voting to?</h3>
<p>The Adhocracy platform provides a lot of information that can be
used to make delegation decisions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Voting records</strong> are the most objective source of documented
	prior behavior and can help to identify a users' positions.</li>
	<li><strong>Comments</strong> within a discussion can give more specific insight on
	a user's approach and position regarding a specific topic.</li>
	<li>Aggregate <strong>Karma scores</strong> with regards to an issue or category
	can help to identify regular contributors.</li>
	<li>Off-channel communication, such as <strong>blogs and Twitter</strong> can also
	be a valuable source for identifying the opinion leaders which most
	closely represent one's opinions.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the major goals of the next version of Adhocracy will be to introduce more
intelligent automated comparisons among the users to generate reliable
recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="AretheresecretvotesinAdhocracy">Are there secret votes in
Adhocracy?</h3>
<p>No. A full <strong>public voting record</strong> is available for all users, at
any time. There are three reasons to do this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At its core, <strong>Adhocracy is a discussion tool</strong>. Having the
	participants state their opinions on an issue is a part of this
	discussion and should thus happen in public.</li>
	<li>Without voting records, <strong>delegation becomes useless</strong>. If the
	voting record of delegation agents wasn't published, one would have to
	trust the agents to honestly identify their intentions regarding each
	vote. This would create a critical trust limitation against delegation.
	While one could imagine a system in which only those who wish to
	receive delegations would publish their voting records, such a system
	would create unequal conditions for voting between public and private
	voters, thus violating another important principle of any democratic
	voting system.</li>
	<li>Keeping voting records a secret is hard. Trust in the system
	would be predicated on the assumption that no leaks - including those
	resulting from indirect attacks - occurred. This assumption is bound to
	be compromised at some stage, creating a system with dubious security
	and privacy. Publishing all voting records is thus a step <strong>avoid
	creating misconceptions</strong> among users regarding privacy. The voters
	themselves can then decide whether a particular topic is fit for public
	voting and otherwise go off-channel, using paper ballots.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="WhichvotingsystemdoesAdhocracyuse">Which voting system does
Adhocracy use?</h3>
<p>Adhocracy currently only supports voting on individual proposals,
not the comparative polling on different alternatives regarding an
issue. Starting with the next version of Adhocracy, the software will use a fairly complex variant of <strong>approval voting</strong>. In this
process, users will be able to specify which proposals depend upon each
other and which proposals contradict each other. Proposals will then become
active only if they meet all their dependencies and have the highest
level of approvement among their respective cluster of contradicting
proposals.</p>
<p>While this process is somewhat complicated internally, the voter
will only have to make a binary decision on whether he thinks a proposal
is acceptable or not. Tactical voting is not needed in most approval
voting systems.</p>
<p>Unlike instant runoff systems, approval voting also doesn't
require users to priorize their choices, a process that generates more
information than strictly necessary and that leads to various
inconsistencies such as Arrow's paradox.</p>

<h3 id="CanAdhocracybeusedtoholdelections">Can Adhocracy be used to
hold elections?</h3>
<p>While it is technically possible to elect members of the
community into an office using Adhocracy, <strong>this is highly discouraged</strong>.
Arguing for or against the capabilities and personality of a candidate
is a process that is fundamentally different from arguing a position on
an issue. A secret vote is, therefore, an essential element of any
election. Adhocracy cannot offer any degree of secrecy. Additionally,
the delegation system will produce odd incentives when used in an
election setting.</p>

<h3 id="IsAdhocracysecure">Is Adhocracy secure?</h3>
<p>For a long time, smart people have tried to build voting machines
that no attacker can tamper with. Concepts for this usually integrate
strong cryptographic mechanisms that allow the voting authority to
verify the identity of the voter. Unfortunately, most of these proposals
are extremely complicated and require the user to install special
software on their PC, follow non-trivial processes and to manage
cryptographic keys. Yet, even these tools do not guarantee perfect
security: shit just happens.</p>
<p>Adhocracy values access and usability over ultimate security.
Since the goal is to structure a debate and not to command an army, the
focus, instead, is on creating tools that will make it more obvious when
shit starts happening. The core principle of this, an idea called Soft Security,
demands that Adhocracy should <strong>keep you informed</strong> about your past actions
and the way in which polling results come about.</p>

<h3 id="WhatisKarma">What is Karma?</h3>
<p>Karma is a way for a community to structure its debates:
Contributions are rated by their readers. Good contributions score
higher than boring or redundant ones, and are thus shown above the
others. <strong>This helps the group to keep focussed</strong>.</p>
<p>When people aggregate Karma points (i.e. upvotes on their
contributions), they gain the ability to perform certain tasks that are
usually restricted. Thus all those actions are potentially available to
everyone, but <strong>have to be 'earned'</strong> by advancing the debate. These tasks
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Scoring on (5 points) and editing (30 points) other people's
	comments</li>
	<li>Editing arbitrary proposals or issues (200 points each)</li>
	<li>Beginning and cancelling votes on a proposal. (300 points
	each)</li>
	<li>Deleting comments or proposals (500 points)</li>
	<li>Creating and editing categories (600 points)</li>
	<li>Deleting categories or issues (1000 points)</li>
	<li>Voting is, of course, excepted from the karma system</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for users who have proven their interest in a rich
debate to gradually become moderators of that debate. It also keeps
trolls or extremists from overly influencing the debate.</p>

<h3 id="Whycanotherseditmycomments">Why can others edit my
comments?</h3>
<p>To avoid redundancy. In most internet forums, when a good
argument has been made, there is usually a stream of additions and
examples provided by other users that end up spamming the thread. Having
the ability to edit the original argument allows you to decide whether
to add your extension to the original comment or to create a new one.</p>
<p>This way, the new comment is no longer a static step of the
conversation but can become <strong>a living and growing argument</strong> that is
supported by its own community of editors.</p>

<h3 id="YoustoleideasfromStackOverflowRedditDiggHN">You stole ideas
from StackOverflow/Reddit/Digg/HN!</h3>
<p>True. These tools, I think, are the pinnacle of what online
debate can look like at the moment. StackOverflow,
unfortunately, is based on the assumption that there is a right answer
to any question. This, of course, is not true in a political setting. So
I used some SO ideas (including the graduate membership thing and, I'll
admit, the layout) and repackaged them.</p>
