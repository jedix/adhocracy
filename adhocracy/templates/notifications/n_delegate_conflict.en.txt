Your delegate, ${e.vote.delegation.agent.name}, voted ${common.vote(e.vote)} the ${e.poll.motion.label}. 

This conflicts with a vote from one of your other delegates. As a consequence of this conflict, you're currently abstaining on the motion.    

To vote yourself, visit the poll page: ${h.instance_url(e.poll.motion.instance, path="/motion/%s" % str(e.poll.motion.id))}
